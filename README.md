# next-js-app

Showcase a simple frontend and backend built upon Next JS.

Due to the short timespan very little functionality was delivered. No POST, PATCH or DELETE requests are available, nor any form validation.

If there was more time I would expand the API and finetune the User interface. There was with some groundwork done for a containerized environment, which would include a mySQL database and a database administration tool.
